# 215-Homework-0-Public

1. The Goal
This homework is designed to be a "warmup assignment" to familiarize you with basic Java syntax. In this assignment, you will complete the definition of a simple class that can be used to find the prime factorization of an input integer. Prime factorization consists of decomposing an integer into the product of a series of prime integers. As examples:

The prime factorization of 2 is 2.
The prime factorization of 4 is 2 x 2.
The prime factorization of 12345 is 3 x 5 x 823.

1.A. Pedagogical Goals
In completing this assignment, you will master basic Java syntax, including:

Implementing constructors and class methods.
Declaring, defining, and using variables of primitive types and arrays.
Using loops and conditionals to impose control flow.
Invoking methods from builtin packages (specifically java.lang.Math).
In addition, you will begin to practice two skills that will be overarching themes for the class:

Translating written specifications into code.
Writing thorough test suites and using those test suites to debug your code.
For this assignment only, you may not use any data types other than primitive types and arrays. Even if you're familiar with them from outside of class, you may not use built-in Object types such as ArrayLists. This homework is meant to exercise your knowledge of arrays; you will be welcome and encouraged to use other types in the future.
